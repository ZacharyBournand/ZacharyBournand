Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Zachary Bournand
========================================================================================================================================

And I am a Computer Science Student at the University of Florida
----------------------------------------------------------------

I did an intensive 6-month full-stack JavaScript program that ended in May of 2021 at a coding bootcamp called O‚Äôclock in the Paris region, where I grew up during my childhood.

For the last month of my coding program, I and my awesome team of 3 other members built a MVP of our e-commerce website intended for medical professionals to buy and sell medicine that cannot be sold to individuals because they expire soon. It is intended to reduce the $1.1 billion annual waste of medical products in France and allows more patients to get cured.

Then, I did a summer internship at a large publishing company in France called Eyrolles. I developed a web application in PHP with the framework Symfony that allows its employees taking care of publications to write reviews on them and have these printed out as banners that attach to the cover page.

From November to December 2022, I and my teammate built a movie search engine in C++ that allows the user, via the console, to search through a catalog of thousands of movies and ratings via many different search filter options available. 

I am currently a Computer Science student at the University of Florida in my junior year of college. I want to pursue this career path because it allows me to be creative, and I get to continuously improve myself through the challenges I face. I never want to stop learning, so I can keep applying my newfound knowledge to add value to people‚Äôs lives.
