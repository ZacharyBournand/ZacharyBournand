Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Zachary Bournand
========================================================================================================================================

And I am a Computer Science Student at the University of Florida
----------------------------------------------------------------

From an early age, I have been curious about how we are able to build such intricate technologies. Now, I want to contribute to this space to help solve real-world problems.

After learning the basics of the programming language Python, I decided to attend an intensive 6-month full-stack JavaScript program that ended in May of 2021. It was at a coding bootcamp called O‚Äôclock in the Paris region, where I grew up during my childhood. I learned great coding practices, and I got much better at problem-solving and debugging.

For the last month of my coding program, I and my awesome team of 3 other members built a minimum viable product of our e-commerce website intended for medical professionals to buy and sell medicine that cannot be sold to individuals because they expire soon. This helps reduce the $1.1 billion annual waste of medical products in France and allows more patients to get cured.

Then, I did a summer internship at Eyrolles, which is one of the largest independent publishing companies in France. I developed a web application that allows its employees taking care of publications to write reviews on them and have these printed out as banners that attach to the cover page. I got to acquire lots of knowledge in PHP and the framework Symfony, and I got to see the inner workings of a company.

I started attending the University of Florida in the Fall of 2021. And from November to December 2022, I and my teammate built a movie search engine in C++ that allows the user, via the console, to search through a catalog of thousands of movies and ratings via many different search filter options available. I am currently a Computer Science student at the University of Florida in my junior year of college.

I want to pursue this career path because it allows me to be creative, and I get to continuously improve myself through the challenges I face. I never want to stop learning, so I can keep applying my newfound knowledge to add value to people‚Äôs lives. And the software industry allows me to do exactly that.
