Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif), my name is Zachary Bournand
========================================================================================================================================

And I am a recent Computer Science graduate (Dec. 2024) from the University of Florida
----------------------------------------------------------------

I grew up in France up until 11th grade, before moving to the United States with my dual French-American citizenship where I adapted to a new environment. During my higher education journey, I‚Äôve sharpened both my technical and teamwork skills through academic studies, coding projects, and an internship that deepened my understanding of the professional world. Below are highlights of my experiences:

* In December 2024, I graduated from the University of Florida with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science that I started pursuing in August 2021.

* From August to December 2024, I collaborated with 4 teammates to build and deploy a <a href="https://github.com/ysheliakin/pallass" target="_blank">research collaboration web application</a> in React and Go that enables researchers to collaborate and search for funding opportunities.

* From January to July 2023, I collaborated with 3 team members to build a <a href="https://github.com/ZacharyBournand/crave-finder" target="_blank">restaurant finder web application</a> in Angular and Go that enables users to search for a restaurant by inputting its name or a dish in a given city and to rate its dishes.

* From November to December 2022, my teammate and I built a <a href="https://github.com/ZacharyBournand/movie-search-engine" target="_blank">movie search engine</a> in C++.

* In the summer of 2021, I interned at Eyrolles, which is one of the largest independent publishing companies in France. I developed a web application using PHP and its framework Symfony.

* From April to May 2021, my 3 teammates and I built an <a href="https://github.com/ZacharyBournand/omedocs-back" target="_blank">e-commerce web application</a> in React/Redux and Node.js/Express for medical professionals to buy and sell medicine that cannot be sold to individuals because they expire soon. It is aimed at reducing the $1.1 billion annual waste of medicine in France.

* From November 2020 to May 2021, I did a full-stack JavaScript program at a coding bootcamp: O‚Äôclock, in the Paris region.

* In August 2020, I earned an A.A. degree in Computer Science that I started pursuing in May 2018.

I want to pursue this career path because it allows me to be creative and continuously improve through the challenges I face. Having recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Florida, I am eager to turn this passion into a career that adds value to people's lives.

* üåç¬† I am based in Tampa Bay, Florida and willing to relocate for my career.
