Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Zachary Bournand
========================================================================================================================================

And I am a Computer Science student at the University of Florida
----------------------------------------------------------------

Here are some interesting facts about me:
* I did a 6-month full-stack JavaScript program that ended in May of 2021 at a coding bootcamp called O‚Äôclock, in the Paris region.

* For the last month of my coding program, I and my awesome team of 3 other members built an <a href="https://github.com/Geoffrey-Maillot/O-medocs_back" target="_blank">e-commerce website</a> for medical professionals to buy and sell medicine that cannot be sold to individuals because they expire soon.

* In the summer of 2021, I interned at a large publishing company called Eyrolles in Paris, France. I developed a web application using PHP and its framework Symfony.

* From November to December 2022, I and my teammate built a <a href="https://github.com/ZacharyBournand/movie-search-engine">movie search engine</a> in C++. 

I am currently a Computer Science student at the University of Florida in my junior year of college. I want to pursue this career path because it allows me to be creative, and I get to continuously improve myself through the challenges I face.
